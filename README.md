# navMistral

**Extends Le Chat's conversation navigation options!**

- Hide all Mistral's posts and shorten your posts to get a good overview of everything you asked
- Click on a button next to one of your posts and be taken to that point of conversation

**How to use:**

Go to your Manage extensions panel and enable dev mode. After that, you can add the folder by "load unpacked". This was made using a Chromium browser, but it should work on Firefox with some minor chances since the script is very simple.

Chrome and Firefox store versions should come soon.
